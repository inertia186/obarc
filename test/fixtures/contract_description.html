<h4>It's-a Me, Monopoly!</h4>
<p>
  The race to save the Mushroom Kingdom has taken a turn toward real
  estate investing! Why punch blocks and jump on the heads of goombas,
  when you can mortgage World 1-1 and build an empire, and send all
  the koopas to jail! Just be sure that none of them have a "Get out
  of jail free" power-up, first.

  Classic Monopoly meets classic 8-bit Super Mario Bros with this
  Collector's Edition board game. Play as 8-bit Mario, Luigi, Princess
  Peach, Toad, Super Mushroom, or 1-Up Mushroom, and conquer the
  kingdom before your opponents can! With custom 8-bit goal posts and
  castles to replace the traditional houses and hotels, and tons of
  other classic Mario Bros references all throughout the game. You'll
  be humming the familiar theme as you make your way around the board
  and buy up all of the Worlds!
